# Browser-Object-Model


Wikipedia: The *Browser Object Model (BOM)* is a browser-specific convention
referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser. Unlike the [Document
Object Model](https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/about-Document-Object-Model),
there is no standard for implementation and no strict definition,
so browser vendors are free to implement the BOM in any way they wish.
